# zenoh-codec

A `#![no_std]`, `no_alloc` crate to write structs, extensions and messages for the Zenoh protocol.

## Example


## Maintainability

I tried my best to keep the code as maintainable as possible but it's not easy to write easy to follow
`proc-macros`.

Some work must be done:
- [x] Try to simplify the `flag` part
- [x] Try to simplify the `len` part
- [ ] Try to simplify the `decode` part
